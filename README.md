# Privacy-on-Federated-Learning
Comparative Analysis of Data Anonymization Techniques on Federated Learning

Techniques used:
1) Differential Privacy (Dependancies: IBM's diffprivlib library)
2) Fully Homomorphic Encryption (Dependancies: TFHE (Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus) open source library)
3) Secure Multi-Party Computation (Dependancies: Python's PySyft Library)

Fedearated Learning implemented using TensorFlow's toolkit
